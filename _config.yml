# Helpful notes (customize before publishing):
# - Replace `url` and `baseurl` with your GitHub Pages values when publishing.
# - Add images in `assets/images/` (logo.png, avatar.png, header.jpg, favicon.ico).
# - To use the Minimal Mistakes theme with GitHub Pages, either enable GitHub Pages' built-in gem support
#   or add a Gemfile with `gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"` and publish from the `gh-pages`/`main` branch.
